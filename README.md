- 👋 Hi, I’m @Shradheya7
- 👀 I’m interested in ... Programming. No matter what language I am working on I have learned that it is always more fun to learn new things instead of just wasting time to justify what is wrong or right.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning MERN Stack, Postgress, Rasa, Python, FastAPI
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on almost anything. Hell if you have a robotics project and you need me on Objective C or maybe C++, No Issues. Always up for new things.
- 📫 How to reach me well you have my email shradheyakumar7@gmail.com, linkedin.com/in/Shradheya7
